  "raylib [core] example - input actions.

  Decodes input as abstract ACTIONS instead of raw keys, so a binding maps
  to a key AND a gamepad button at once and can be remapped freely. Move the
  square with the movement action (WASD by default), SPACE fires (recentres
  + flashes blue for one frame), TAB swaps to the arrow-key set. No new
  bindings: the d-pad is already PAD-UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT and the face buttons
  are already PAD-Y/A/X/B (raylib's LEFT_FACE_* / RIGHT_FACE_* under
  different names, added for input-gamepad.clj), plus one small addition,
  gamepad-released?, mirroring gamepad-down?/gamepad-pressed? exactly.
  Ported from raylib's examples/core/core_input_actions.c."
