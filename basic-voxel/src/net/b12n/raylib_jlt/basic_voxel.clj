  "raylib [models] example - basic voxel (`jolt -M:basic-voxel`).

  Port of raylib's examples/models/models_basic_voxel.c. An 8x8x8 block of
  voxels you walk around in first person, WASD to move and the mouse to look.
  Left-click removes whichever voxel the crosshair is on, so the block hollows
  out a cube at a time.

  Zero new FFI. The C builds a cube mesh, wraps it in a Model and calls
  DrawModel once per voxel, which for a unit cube is exactly what the by-value
  `rl/draw-cube!` already draws, with `rl/draw-cube-wires!` for the outline.

  Three deviations, all about the camera. UpdateCamera's first-person mode turns
  on the raw GetMouseDelta, which means the view drifts whenever the pointer
  moves at all, including while the window is still taking focus, so a headless
  screenshot never lands on the same frame twice. This keeps the yaw/pitch walk
  camera-3d-first-person already uses: absolute GetMouseX/GetMouseY, no delta,
  nothing to drift. The eye starts backed off above the block rather than at
  ground level beside it, so the opening frame shows what there is to click. And
  until you touch a key or the mouse it orbits the block on its own, because no
  synthetic input actuates a raylib window (see the note in
  scripts/demo_manifest.edn) and an example with no motion of its own records as
  a single frame. The first WASD press or mouse move hands it over for good.

  The pick is the C's method, brute force over every remaining voxel rather than
  a DDA march through the grid. GetScreenToWorldRay is not bound, and for a ray
  through the centre of the screen it does not need to be: that ray is the look
  direction the camera was just built from. `hit-distance` is the slab test
  GetRayCollisionBox does, clipping the ray against each axis pair in turn and
  keeping the voxel whose surviving interval starts nearest."
