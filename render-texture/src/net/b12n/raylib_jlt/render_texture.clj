  "raylib [textures] example - render texture (`jolt -M:render-texture`).

  A bouncing-ball scene is drawn once into an off-screen framebuffer, then that
  framebuffer's texture is drawn back to the window four times at different
  scales, tints and rotogravure-ish offsets. Drawing the scene is paid for once no
  matter how many copies appear.

  raylib spells this BeginTextureMode / EndTextureMode over a RenderTexture2D
  struct; rl/with-render-texture is the same thing in scalar rlgl calls (see
  net.b12n.raylib.textures). One wrinkle carries over from OpenGL: a framebuffer texture is
  stored bottom-up, so it is drawn back with :v0 1.0 :v1 0.0 to flip it."
