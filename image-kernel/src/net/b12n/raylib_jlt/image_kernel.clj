  "raylib [textures] example - image kernel (`jolt -M:image-kernel`).

  Port of raylib's examples/textures/textures_image_kernel.c. The same picture
  four times: untouched, sharpened, run through a Sobel operator, and blurred by
  six passes of a Gaussian. Every one of them is `ImageKernelConvolution`, the
  same call with a different nine numbers.

  New FFI: `ImageKernelConvolution` and `ImageCrop`, both in place on an
  `Image *` like the colour operations, except that crop's `Rectangle` is by
  value, four floats in 16 bytes. Worth noting that the convolution takes the
  kernel's COUNT rather than its side length, so a 3x3 is passed as 9.

  Kernels are normalised first, dividing by the sum of their entries, which is
  what keeps the sharpen and Gaussian results at the same overall brightness as
  the source. Sobel's entries sum to zero, so it is left alone, and the C's own
  normaliser has the same guard.

  That zero sum has a consequence worth knowing about, because it is invisible
  until it bites. raylib convolves the ALPHA channel along with the colours and,
  unlike the colours, does not clamp the result, so a zero-sum kernel drives
  alpha to zero across every flat region: the Sobel edges are computed correctly
  and then drawn completely transparent. Measured here, not guessed, by looking
  at the panel and finding it blank. Dropping the image to a format with no
  alpha channel and converting back is the cheapest way to say opaque again.

  The C opens `resources/cat.png`. This suite ships no image files, so the
  source is a test card drawn with `texture-from-fn` and pulled back off the GPU
  with `image-from-texture!`. It is built for this job: concentric rings at the
  top for curved edges, a fine checker in the middle that only survives the
  sharpen, and a smooth gradient at the bottom that only the Sobel leaves blank."
