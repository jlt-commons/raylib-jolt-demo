(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.random-sequence
  "raylib [core] example - random sequence (`jolt -M:random-sequence`).

  Port of raylib's examples/core/core_random_sequence.c. A row of coloured bars
  whose heights are a shuffled sequence. SPACE reshuffles, UP and DOWN change how
  many bars there are.

  The example is about LoadRandomSequence, which hands back each value in a range
  exactly once in random order. That is a different thing from GetRandomValue,
  which is bound here and which samples with replacement: calling it n times gives
  duplicates and gaps, so the bars would not be a permutation and reshuffling
  would change the set rather than just the order. Clojure's shuffle is the same
  guarantee, so this uses it and leaves get-random-value to the examples that
  genuinely want independent draws.

  Reshuffling only reorders. Watch a colour move rather than change: the bars
  keep their heights and hues across a SPACE, which is the property the example
  is demonstrating."
