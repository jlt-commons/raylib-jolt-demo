  "raylib [shapes] example - rlgl color wheel (`jolt -M:rlgl-color-wheel`).

  Port of raylib's examples/shapes/shapes_rlgl_color_wheel.c. A hue wheel built
  as a triangle fan through rlgl. The wheel is a ring of triangles sharing the
  centre, each rim vertex carrying its own hue, so the GPU interpolates every
  shade between them and a few dozen triangles cover the whole spectrum.

  The mouse wheel changes how many triangles there are, which is the point: at
  eight the interpolation is visible as flat wedges, and by sixty-four the wheel
  looks continuous. UP and DOWN resize it, SPACE switches between the filled fan
  and its wireframe, and the centre brightness follows the arrow keys.

  ColorFromHSV is not bound, so hue-to-RGB is done here. It is the standard
  piecewise conversion, and at full saturation and value it reduces to walking
  the six edges of the RGB cube.

  See color-wheel for the same subject drawn with filled sectors instead, and
  rlgl-triangle for per-vertex colour on a single triangle."
