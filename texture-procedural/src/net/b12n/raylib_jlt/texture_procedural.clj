(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.texture-procedural
  "raylib [textures] example - procedural textures (`jolt -M:texture-procedural`).

  Four textures generated pixel by pixel and uploaded to the GPU: a checkerboard,
  a two-axis gradient, white noise, and concentric rings. SPACE regenerates the
  noise, which re-uploads that one texture in place.

  This is the closest jolt gets to raylib's [textures] category. LoadTexture and
  LoadImage return structs by value and so have no binding (see
  net.b12n.raylib.textures and net.b12n.raylib.images), but
  rlgl's layer underneath them is entirely scalar: rl/texture-from-fn builds the
  RGBA8 buffer in native memory and hands the pointer to rlLoadTexture, and
  rl/texture! draws it as an rlgl quad. Nothing is read off disk, so every texel
  here comes from a Clojure function of (x, y)."
