  "raylib [textures] example - image generation (`jolt -M:image-generation`).

  Port of raylib's examples/textures/textures_image_generation.c. Nine
  full-screen textures, none of them loaded from anywhere: click or press RIGHT
  to cycle through three linear gradients, a radial and a square one, a
  checkerboard, white noise, Perlin noise and a cellular field. Each one is
  generated once at startup and lives on the GPU from then on.

  This is the first example on the suite's new `Image` bindings, and the
  generators are exactly why they were worth having. `Image` is
  `{void *data; int width, height, mipmaps, format;}`, 24 bytes returned by
  value from every `GenImage*` call and taken by value by everything that
  consumes one. That has been expressible since jolt 0.7.23 and nothing here
  had used it for pixels yet.

  What `rl/image-*` hands back is an rlgl texture id rather than the `Image` or
  the `Texture2D`, which is what makes this a small addition rather than a new
  drawing path: `texture!`, `texture-filter!` and `unload-texture!` all speak ids
  already, so a generated image draws through the same code a `texture-from-fn`
  one does. The `Image` itself is freed inside the call, once its pixels have
  reached the GPU.

  Deviation: the view cycles on its own every couple of seconds until you click
  or press a key, since no synthetic input actuates a raylib window (see the note
  in scripts/demo_manifest.edn) and a single texture held still is one frame."
