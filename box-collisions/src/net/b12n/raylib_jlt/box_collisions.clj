  "raylib [models] example - box collisions (`joltc -M:box-collisions`).

  A player cube moves with WASD across a grid; each static obstacle box turns red
  when the player's box overlaps it (3D AABB overlap, computed in Clojure, no
  by-value Rectangle/BoundingBox needed). Reuses the 3D path (Camera3D by value +
  rl/cube!) under a fixed 3/4 camera. The player spawns already touching one box,
  so the collision highlight is visible from frame 0."
