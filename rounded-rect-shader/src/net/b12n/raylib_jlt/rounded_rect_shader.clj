  "raylib [shaders] example - SDF rounded rectangles (`jolt -M:rounded-rect-shader`).

  Fill, border and drop shadow from one signed distance function, evaluated per
  pixel. The distance to a rounded rectangle is a two-line closed form, and every
  visual feature falls out of thresholding it: inside is fill, a band either side
  of zero is the border, and the same distance blurred and offset is the shadow.

  That is the point of the technique. A rounded rectangle built from geometry
  needs corner tessellation, and its border and shadow need separate passes and
  separate meshes; here changing the radius is changing one number, and antialias
  is free because the distance is continuous rather than sampled.

  Compare `rounded-rectangle` elsewhere in this suite, which builds the same shape
  out of rl/sector! corners and rectangles - the honest way to do it without a
  shader, and visibly more code for a harder-edged result.

  Drag to move the card, wheel changes the corner radius, UP/DOWN the border
  width, SPACE cycles what is drawn: everything, then the raw distance field."
