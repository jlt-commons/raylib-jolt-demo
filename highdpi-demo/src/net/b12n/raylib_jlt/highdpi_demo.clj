  "raylib [core] example - highdpi demo (`jolt -M:highdpi-demo`).

  Port of raylib's examples/core/core_highdpi_demo.c. Two rulers over the same
  window: the orange one counts the logical points raylib draws in, the blue one
  counts the physical pixels the display actually has. On a Retina panel the blue
  ruler runs twice as far in the same space, which is the whole lesson. N moves
  the window to the next monitor, and the window is resizable so you can watch
  both rulers re-measure.

  Two new bindings, both scalar: `SetWindowMinSize` and `SetWindowMonitor`.

  This is the example that needs `FLAG_WINDOW_HIGHDPI`, and it is the only one in
  the suite that sets it. Measured here rather than assumed: without the flag
  `GetScreenWidth` and `GetRenderWidth` both answer 800 and the DPI scale is 1.0,
  so the two rulers would be identical and there would be nothing to show. With
  it the render target is 1600 wide against 800 logical points, scale 2.0.

  The cost is that its headless screenshot is not trustworthy. `highdpi-testbed`
  documents why: the capture doubles the scale again on top of the flag's own
  doubling, so the drawn content fills one quadrant of the dumped PNG. That is a
  property of the capture path, not of this example, and the window itself is
  correct. `highdpi-testbed` is the one to run when you want the same numbers in
  a shot that behaves.

  The C centres its labels with `MeasureTextEx` and `DrawTextEx` at a spacing of
  3. `MeasureText` and `DrawText` are already bound and answer the same question
  for the default font, so the labels are centred with those."
