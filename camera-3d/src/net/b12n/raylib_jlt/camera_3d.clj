  "raylib [core] example - 3D camera (`joltc -M:camera-3d`).

  An orbiting perspective camera looks at a shaded cube standing on a ground grid.

  This is the project's 3D milestone. It proves two things at once:
   • Camera3D (a 44-byte struct) is passed BY VALUE to BeginMode3D via a pointer,
     the same >16-byte-struct-by-pointer trick as Camera2D (net.b12n.raylib.camera/with-camera-3d).
   • The cube is built with rlgl immediate mode (net.b12n.raylib.models/cube! → rl-vertex-3f)
     because raylib's DrawCube takes a Vector3 BY VALUE, a 12-byte float struct
     passed in FP registers, which the pointer trick does NOT cover. DrawGrid is
     scalar."
