  "raylib [models] example - mesh generation (`jolt -M:mesh-generation`).

  Port of raylib's examples/models/models_mesh_generation.c. Eight shapes from
  the GenMesh* family, laid out on a grid and turning together, each drawn with
  DrawMesh under its own transform.

  This is the first example in the suite to use raylib's real mesh API rather
  than an rlgl stand-in. Everything 3D here until now went through immediate
  mode, because Mesh is 120 bytes and Material and Matrix are 40 and 64, and
  jolt could not pass or return a struct by value before 0.7.23. It can now,
  with two rules the spike for this example had to find the hard way:

    * An aggregate-returning call takes a caller-owned destination pointer as
      its FIRST argument. (mesh-cube! m w h l) is four arguments, not three,
      and getting that wrong is an arity error rather than a crash.
    * An aggregate argument is a pointer to the struct bytes, so DrawMesh takes
      three pointers even though its C signature is three values.

  The layouts come from the header that matches the linked library rather than
  from a raylib source checkout, which may sit any number of commits past the
  release. The two agree on Mesh today, so nothing here depended on it, and an
  earlier version of this docstring wrongly said they disagreed. The habit is
  still worth keeping: that same checkout has three times offered a FUNCTION
  the released library does not export, and DrawCircleLinesEx,
  BeginPortalMode3D and GenMeshPoints each compiled and then failed at run
  time.

  GenMesh* uploads to the GPU on its own, so each mesh has a live vao id the
  moment it is generated and there is no UploadMesh call here.

  UP and DOWN change how fast the grid turns; SPACE pauses it."
