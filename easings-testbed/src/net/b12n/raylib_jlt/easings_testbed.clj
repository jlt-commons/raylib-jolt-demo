  "raylib [shapes] example - easings testbed (`jolt -M:easings-testbed`).

  Port of raylib's examples/shapes/shapes_easings_testbed.c. One curve at a time,
  plotted across the window with a ball running along it, so you can see the
  shape and feel the timing together. RIGHT and LEFT change curve, SPACE
  replays, D toggles the plot.

  A curve alone is hard to judge. Elastic and back both leave the [0,1] band,
  which is obvious on a plot and invisible in a number; bounce and elastic feel
  similar described in words and nothing alike in motion. Showing both at once is
  the whole point of a testbed.

  The plot is drawn by sampling the curve at one point per pixel of width and
  joining them, which is also the cheapest way to see a curve overshoot: the line
  simply leaves the box.

  Curves come from reasings/by-name, the shared table that also feeds
  easings-ball and easings-box. Adding a curve there adds it here for free."
