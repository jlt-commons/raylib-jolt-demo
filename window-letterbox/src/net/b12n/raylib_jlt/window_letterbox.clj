  "raylib [core] example - window letterbox (`jolt -M:window-letterbox`).

  The picture is drawn at a fixed 480x360 whatever size the window is. Press R to
  make the window resizable, then drag a corner: the picture scales to the largest
  multiple that fits, centred, with black bars on whichever axis has room left
  over. The readout along the bottom reports the window size, the scale and the
  bar size.

  This is what a render texture is for outside of effects: it decouples the
  resolution you design against from the one the viewer happens to have. The mouse
  is mapped back through the same transform, so the crosshair lands on the right
  virtual pixel at any window size.

  The window starts fixed and R turns resizability on at runtime rather than
  SetConfigFlags turning it on before InitWindow. Same end state, but a window
  that is resizable from creation reports a frame the demo recorder cannot keep
  up with, and every capture of this example failed on a mid-recording size
  change."
