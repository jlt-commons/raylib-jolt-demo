  "raylib [audio] example - stream callback (`jolt -M:audio-stream-callback`).

  Port of raylib's examples/audio/audio_stream_callback.c. A 44.1kHz mono stream
  that raudio pulls from rather than one this code pushes to: UP and DOWN change
  the pitch, LEFT and RIGHT cycle sine, square, triangle and sawtooth. The
  samples raudio actually took are drawn underneath.

  The pull is the point, and it is the harder of the suite's two callbacks.
  `custom-logging` gives raylib a function pointer raylib calls on whichever
  thread called into it, which is this one. raudio runs its OWN audio thread and
  calls back from there, on a thread jolt never started, so the entry point needs
  jolt's `:collect-safe`, which reactivates the thread before any jolt code runs
  on it. Without that the process dies with a memory fault no handler can catch.

  Being on the audio thread also sets the budget: the callback owes raudio its
  samples before the device underruns, so the loop writes floats straight into
  raudio's buffer with `ffi/write` and allocates nothing per sample. The scope at
  the bottom is the same discipline. It is a plain native ring buffer the
  callback writes a second copy into, with its cursor kept in the last four bytes
  of the same block, so drawing what played costs the audio thread one more
  float store and no allocation at all.

  Contrast with `audio-raw-stream`, which pushes: it asks
  `IsAudioStreamProcessed` every frame and refills with `UpdateAudioStream` when
  raudio has drained a buffer. Same sound, opposite direction, and the push
  version never leaves the main thread."
