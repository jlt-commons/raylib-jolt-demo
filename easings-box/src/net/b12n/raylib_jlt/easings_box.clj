  "raylib [shapes] example - easings box anim (`jolt -M:easings-box`).

  Port of raylib's examples/shapes/shapes_easings_box.c. A square drops in,
  flattens into a bar, spins, grows to fill the window, then fades. SPACE
  restarts.

  Five stages, a different curve on each, chosen to contrast rather than to look
  uniform:

  - Drop on EaseElasticOut, which overshoots and springs back.
  - Flatten on EaseBounceOut, so the bar settles in decreasing hops.
  - Spin 270 degrees on EaseQuadOut, a plain decelerate against the two springy
    stages either side of it.
  - Grow on EaseCircOut, which starts fast and brakes hard.
  - Fade on EaseSineOut, the gentlest of them, so the end is unhurried.

  The square rotates about its own centre, which needs DrawRectanglePro. That
  takes a Rectangle and a Vector2 by value and is not bindable, so rect-pro!
  draws it as an rlgl quad.

  Curves come from reasings, keeping raylib's (t, b, c, d) signature. See
  easings-ball for the same idea on three stages, and easings for the whole
  family side by side."
