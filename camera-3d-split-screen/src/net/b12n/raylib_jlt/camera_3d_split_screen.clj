  "raylib [core] example - 3d camera split screen.

  Two players roam a plane of cube trees, each seeing the world from their
  own camera in half the screen: player 1 moves with W/S (along z), player
  2 with UP/DOWN (along x); each is drawn as a colored cube in both views.
  Each half is rendered into its own render texture, then blitted side by
  side, same y-flip convention every other render-texture blit in this
  suite uses. The one new binding this needed was DrawPlane, genuinely by
  value now that Vector2/Vector3 by-value args work (see draw-cube! and
  friends in net.b12n.raylib.models). Ported from raylib's
  examples/core/core_3d_camera_split_screen.c."
