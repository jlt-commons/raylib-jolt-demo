  "raylib [shapes] example - ellipse collision (`jolt -M:ellipse-collision`).

  Port of raylib's examples/shapes/shapes_ellipse_collision.c. Two ellipses, one
  following the mouse. Both turn red when they overlap. A and B choose which one
  you are steering.

  DrawEllipse is bound, DrawEllipseLines is not, so the outlines are a line loop
  through rlgl immediate mode. That is the same trade the rest of the suite makes
  for Vector2-taking shape calls, and it costs one helper.

  The overlap test is the interesting part. Two ellipses do not have a closed-form
  intersection test the way two circles do, so raylib samples: it walks points
  around one ellipse's rim and asks whether any lands inside the other. That is
  approximate, and the sample count is the accuracy. Point-in-ellipse itself is
  exact, being the unit-circle test after dividing out each radius."
