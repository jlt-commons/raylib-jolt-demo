  "raylib [textures] example - screen buffer.

  The classic DOS fire effect as a software screen buffer: a low-res
  palette-indexed grid is simulated every frame (embers grow at the
  bottom row, rise with random drift and decay) and blitted through a
  256-color flame palette into a texture drawn scaled up.

  No new FFI: the ember grid is a plain Clojure vector rather than a
  native buffer (doom.clj's own zbuffer takes the same approach), and
  the blit reuses rl/update-texture-from-fn! exactly as every other
  procedural-texture example does. Runs the simulation at 200x112
  rather than the C's 400x225: a persistent-vector rewrite of ~11000
  live cells a frame is about the budget that keeps this near 60fps in
  jolt, and the DOS original was chunky-pixel by nature anyway.
  Ported from raylib's examples/textures/textures_screen_buffer.c."
