  "raylib [core] example - world screen.

  A floating 2D label pinned above a 3D cube: each frame the cube's world
  position projects to screen space via GetWorldToScreen, so the label tracks
  it as the camera orbits. First use of a genuine by-value Camera3D (see
  rl/world-to-screen); the SAME camera opts map drives both with-camera-3d and
  rl/world-to-screen, so the label always matches what actually got drawn.
  Ported from raylib's examples/core/core_world_screen.c."
