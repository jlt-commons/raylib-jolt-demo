(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.rounded-rectangle
  "raylib [shapes] example - rounded rectangle. A rect with quarter-circle corners,
  built from a cross of rects + four sector! corner disks. That hand-rolling dates from
  when raylib's DrawRectangleRounded was genuinely out of reach: it takes a Rectangle by
  value and jolt could not pass one. jolt 0.7.23 changed that, and rl/rect-rounded! now
  binds the real call (see net.b12n.raylib-jlt.outlines-thickness). This example is left
  on the hand-rolled path deliberately, the way the rest of the suite's rlgl stand-ins
  are, rather than migrated in passing. The corner radius animates 0 -> max. Port of
  shapes_rounded_rectangle_drawing."
