(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.storage-values
  "raylib [core] example - storage save/load values (`jolt -M:storage-values`).

  Port of raylib's examples/core/core_storage_values.c. R rolls a new score and
  hi-score, ENTER writes them to disk, SPACE reads them back. Quit and run it
  again to see the values survive.

  raylib's SaveStorageValue and LoadStorageValue treat a file as an array of
  ints addressed by position, growing it as needed. Neither is bound, and neither
  needs to be: the same contract is a few lines over an EDN map, which is also
  inspectable, so `cat storage.edn` shows what was saved instead of a wall of
  bytes.

  The failure modes are the interesting part, and both are handled the way the C
  handles them. Loading before anything was ever saved returns zero rather than
  an error, because a missing file is a legitimate first run. A corrupt or
  unreadable file does the same instead of taking the example down, since a
  demonstration of persistence should not crash on a bad file.

  storage.edn is written to the working directory, matching where raylib puts
  storage.data. It is gitignored."
