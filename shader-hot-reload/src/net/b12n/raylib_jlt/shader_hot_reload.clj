  "raylib [shaders] example - hot-reloading a shader (`jolt -M:shader-hot-reload`).

  Swap the running fragment shader without restarting. 1 and 2 compile two working
  shaders; 3 compiles one that is deliberately broken, which is the case worth
  showing: a shader that fails to compile must leave the previous program running
  and say so, not take the frame down with it.

  That is the whole reason a live shader loop is usable at all. Editing GLSL means
  compiling invalid GLSL most of the time - a half-typed expression is a syntax
  error, and a syntax error every few keystrokes has to be survivable or the loop
  is not a loop.

  rl/shader returns nil on a failed link rather than throwing, so the failure is a
  value the caller decides about. Here the decision is: keep the old program, keep
  drawing, put the compiler's own message on screen. raylib prints the full log to
  stderr, which is where the actual line number lives.

  raylib's own version of this example watches a .fs file's mtime and reloads on
  change. This one keeps its GLSL in the namespace - the same reason every other
  shader here does: nothing reads from disk, so the example runs from anywhere and
  the demo recorder has no working directory to get wrong."
