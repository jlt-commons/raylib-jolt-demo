  "raylib [shaders] example - two samplers (`jolt -M:multi-sampler`).

  raylib binds the texture you draw to sampler slot 0 and names it `texture0`.
  Everything past that is the caller's job: a second sampler is a uniform you
  fill with SetShaderValueTexture. This example blends a checkerboard against a
  radial gradient, with the mix driven by the mouse.

  The call is the reason this example exists. SetShaderValueTexture takes a
  Shader AND a Texture2D, both by value, and on arm64 they travel by different
  routes - Shader is 16 bytes and goes in general-purpose registers, Texture2D is
  20 and is therefore passed indirectly, through a pointer the caller supplies.
  One signature, both ABI paths, which is the case worth having an example of.

  LEFT/RIGHT nudge the mix when the pointer is off-window."
