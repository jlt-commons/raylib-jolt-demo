  "raylib [core] example - basic window (the default: `joltc -M:run`).

  Ported from raylib's examples/core/core_basic_window.c: an 800x450 window that
  clears to RAYWHITE and draws one line of text. The FFI bindings and the keyword-
  argument drawing API live in net.b12n.raylib.all. See README.md for the full example list
  and the Color-by-value explanation."
