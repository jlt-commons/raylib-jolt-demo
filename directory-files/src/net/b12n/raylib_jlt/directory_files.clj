(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.directory-files
  "raylib [core] example - directory files (`jolt -M:directory-files`).

  Port of raylib's examples/core/core_directory_files.c: a file browser that
  starts in the working directory. UP and DOWN move the selection, ENTER or a
  click on a folder goes into it, BACKSPACE goes back up, and the mouse wheel
  scrolls. Directories sort first and are marked; files show their size.

  `rl/directory-files` and `rl/directory-exists?` are new here, though the
  FilePathList binding behind them landed with `drop-files`. The filter passed
  is `\"*.*\"`, which is the one that answers directories AND files; an empty
  filter quietly means files only, which is measured in that function's
  docstring rather than inferred from raylib's header.

  The one real deviation is the whole interface. The C draws its browser with
  raygui, a separate single-header library this suite does not bind: it binds
  the system libraylib and nothing else. So the list, the selection highlight,
  the scrollbar and the path bar are drawn here from `rect!` and `text!`, which
  is a fair trade, since a list view over a vector of strings is not what makes
  the C example interesting.

  Like `drop-files`, this one needs a person. No synthetic input actuates a
  raylib window (see the note in scripts/demo_manifest.edn), so the gallery
  frame shows the opening listing rather than a walk through a tree."
