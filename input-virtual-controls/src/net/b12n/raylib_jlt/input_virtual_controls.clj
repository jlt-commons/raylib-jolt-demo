  "raylib [core] example - input virtual controls (`jolt -M:input-virtual-controls`).

  An on-screen D-pad and action button, the control scheme a touch device needs
  when there is no keyboard. Press a pad segment with the mouse to move the
  square; the A button makes it hop. The keyboard arrows drive the same state, so
  the two input paths stay interchangeable.

  There is nothing raylib-specific about the hit testing: each segment is a circle
  and a wedge of angle around the pad's centre, both plain arithmetic, which is
  what keeps the control layout independent of the drawing API."
