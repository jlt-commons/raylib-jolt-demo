(ns net.b12n.raylib-jlt.undo-redo
  "raylib [core] example - undo redo (`jolt -M:undo-redo`).

  Port of raylib's examples/core/core_undo_redo.c. Drive a square around a grid
  with the arrows, recolour it with SPACE, and step through the history with
  CTRL-Z and CTRL-Y. Visited cells stay on screen as a trail, and the strip along
  the bottom shows the history itself: how many states are held, and where the
  cursor sits inside them.

  The C keeps a 26-slot ring buffer of PlayerState and moves three indices around
  it. That does not port straight across, because the interesting part is the
  bounded history rather than the pointer arithmetic, and Clojure already has a
  better shape for it: a vector of states plus a cursor. Recording past the cap
  drops the oldest entry, which is what the ring achieves by overwriting.

  The one behaviour worth preserving exactly is that a new move after an undo
  discards whatever was ahead. The C gets that by assigning lastUndoIndex after
  it writes, so the redo tail becomes unreachable; here the tail is dropped
  outright."
