  "raylib [core] example - input multitouch (`jolt -M:input-multitouch`).

  Every active touch point, drawn as a labelled circle at its position. On a
  touchscreen that is one circle per finger; on a desktop raylib synthesises point
  0 from the mouse, so holding the left button drags a single point around and the
  count reads 1.

  Worth knowing about the desktop case: raylib updates touch position 0 from the
  cursor-position callback, so GetTouchX / GetTouchY follow the pointer whether or
  not a button is down, while GetTouchPointCount counts only actual presses. The
  hollow ring below tracks the pointer for that reason and the filled circle
  appears only when the count is non-zero.

  GetTouchPointCount and GetTouchPointId are scalar, but raylib's per-index
  GetTouchPosition returns a Vector2 by value and has no binding here, so this
  reads point 0 through the scalar GetTouchX / GetTouchY pair. That is the honest
  limit: the ids of every point are visible, the coordinates of only the first."
