  "Tetris (`joltc -M:tetris`).

  A full Tetris in a 10x20 well: the seven tetrominoes fall, LEFT/RIGHT move,
  UP rotates, DOWN soft-drops, SPACE hard-drops. Full rows clear and score; speed
  rises with level; ENTER restarts after GAME OVER. (Moves are one cell per key
  press, tap to nudge.)

  The whole game is one immutable state map threaded through the loop; `step` reads
  input and returns the next state. The board is a vector of ROWS rows, each a
  vector of COLS cells (nil = empty, else a packed Color)."
