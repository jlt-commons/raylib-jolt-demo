  "raylib [core] example - window flags (`jolt -M:window-flags`).

  The window's configuration bits, toggled live. Number keys 1-4 flip vsync,
  resizable, undecorated and always-on-top; the list shows which are on, read back
  from raylib with IsWindowState rather than from a local copy, so it stays honest
  if the window manager refuses one.

  A bouncing box gives the frame rate something to say: with vsync off the FPS
  counter climbs to whatever the machine can manage, and the box moves by delta
  time so its speed does not change with it."
